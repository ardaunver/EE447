Port B is used for Step Motor PB0,PB1,PB2,PB3 as outputs
(connect 12V to VBus, GND to GND)
Port E is used for Push Buttons PE0,PE1,PE2,PE3 as inputs
(connect VCC to +3.3V, GND to GND)

rotation = -1 means CW rotation (triggered with PushButton1)
rotation = 0 means idle mode (no rotation)
rotation = 1 means CCW rotation (triggered with PushButton2)

Initial value of SysTick->LOAD determines the initial speed.

Change of GPIOB->DATA can be observed at
memory location of 0x400053FC.
GPIOB->DATA will be either one of the following: 1,2,4,8, indicating the motor coils.


Remark: You can also call for another function in SysTick_Handler.

void SysTick_Handler (void){
	button_pressed(rot);
}

void button_pressed(rot){
	....
	Write your code here
	....
}

Change of GPIOE->DATA can be observed at
memory location of 0x400243FC.
GPIOE->DATA is 0x0F by default.
When PushButton1 is pressed, GPIOE->DATA = 0x0E.
When PushButton1 is pressed, GPIOE->DATA = 0x0D.

SPEED DOWN by increasing the period of the SysTick Interrupt.
SPEED UP by decreasing the period of the SysTick Interrupt.
